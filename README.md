<h2>DialogueTest</h2>
Project to learnd how to add simple dialogue in games.

<h3>Full Premise</h3>
After making some experiments here and there with games, I decided that
I wanted to create more mature or thought provoking games. I needed a way
for my characters to express emotions and thoughts directly to the player.
I decided on a system similar to the dialogue in Advance Wars for the GBA,
and this project will focus on creating something like that. At the moment
only the base engine is there but I hope to add more soon. Still trying
to work out a good system for it all in my head but I think I'm just going
to try something and fail faster.

<h2>Do I want help?</h2>
I guess some help would be kind of nice, but more of in the helping to format
code, rather than someone writing a whole dialogue engine and rendering this
project obsolete.
